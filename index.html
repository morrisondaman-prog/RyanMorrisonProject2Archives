    <h2>Conjecture</h2>
       <p>This is an informational document on the history of Pitt football. It documents important events of our school's football history, as well as influential players in the early days of Pitt football (early to mid-20th century). We will also talk about segregation in Pittsburgh, as it is an overlooked part of our city's history. The last event I wanted to talk about was a specific event that the archive doesn’t talk about, that being the destruction of the Pitt stadium. </p>
  </div>

<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
    <h2>Definition</h2>
       <p> The meaning of this archive is to showcase a part of our school's history, an aspect that can be overlooked, as most people, even diehard football fans, don’t really look past the 1950’s when it comes to learning about Pitt football. It consists of our humble beginnings as a school and a football program, as well as an important moment in the history of civil rights. Bobby Grier became the first African-American player to play in the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans. Their opponent, Georgia Tech, was strongly against his playing, but the game went on. In relation to this, there is also Pop Warner and Tony Dorsett, two amazing people who not only influenced Pitt football and won us national championships, but also had a profound impact on their future endeavors. We are a storied program with so much history, but this document really covered the most impactful events that we ever had the honor of being a part of, such as our Sugar bowl victory in 1976, securing us our second national championship in the AP-poll era, and first one in the modern times of football. </p>
  </div>  

<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
    <h2>Quality</h2>
       <p>This information plays the same role any historical article would, that being to keep the memory going and so we can learn from the past. Knowledge can be constructed from the information about Robert “Bobby” Grier, and how he was able to start a movement between Pitt students and Pittsburgh in general, being the first African-American to play in the Sugar Bowl. We can also make knowledgeable assumptions about our football program as a whole, as we have 9 national championships with the likes of legends like Pop Warner, Tony Dorsett, and Larry Fitzgerald making us an established football program.</p>

<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
      <p>I want to focus more on the Bobby Grier story, as it brings in a much bigger issue that we once had as a country, that being segregation. Although Pittsburgh was a place where many African-American families would move to for better opportunity, there was still plenty of segregation within the city. Although zoning by race was deemed illegal by the federal government in 1917, there were ways bank lenders could force black families into certain neighborhoods, with high interest rates in “white” neighborhoods that were made for African-American families to fail. Working with Foucault, I would say the value of this information is to show how a city not really known for being one of segregation background was during this tough time in our country's history. This segment on segregation in Pittsburgh ties into the nation as a whole, and how we used to treat certain groups of people should never be forgotten.</p>

<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
      <p>The archive very obviously excludes all Pitt football events and achievements post-1980. While I do understand that our best football years were mostly in the first half of the 20th century, we are ignoring close to 50 years of Pitt football history where there have been many events significant to our school. A notable one I can think of is our stadium getting taken down, making way for new innovations in its spot. The Pitt Stadium was built in 1925 and our football team played there until 1999. This was an on-campus turf stadium for most of its life, as opposed to the off-campus NFL grass stadium we play in today. For an archive about Pitt football through the years, I believe this would be a very significant event to mention, as many feel like the connection with the football team and students or fans has lessened in the last few decades. Personally, I feel the crowd would be better in an on-campus stadium, but I understand the financial costs of having to keep renovating and maintaining the bleachers and field every few years. The Petersen event center and other buildings in the area are great, and it is definitely a great use of the space, but in my opinion the football culture would be better with an on-campus stadium.</p>

<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">        
To summarize everything in this section, this information holds a lot of significance when talking about Pitt football and the large role it has within our school and cities history, with the two being deeply ingrained with each other. Historians would be the primary users of these articles and archives information, as they are the ones who will talk about how the past was and how we’ve improved and what we can still work on, but us as citizens and residents of this great city can always be curious of how things used to work in our country and in Pittsburgh.</p>

    <h2>Policy</h2>
       <p>I think this information raises the question of how much we really look at Pitt and Pittsburgh’s history, and how willing we are to work off of that history. For example, our football team was great in the early 1900’s, but that was a long time ago, and we should focus on creating new history for our program. We can use this focus to work on the other ideas this archive dives into, such as segregation in present times, as we can’t ignore that it is still there. By studying this archive, we see how even a single document can shape our understanding of history and inspire new questions that continue to matter today.</p>
